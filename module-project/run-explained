COMMAND NUMBER 1)

There are two parts to this command, the javac and find commands.

The find command is simply outputting a list of all .java files under our simple-modules directory. We can then feed that list directly into the Java compiler.

The only thing we have to do differently than the older versions of Java is to provide a module-source-path parameter to inform the compiler that itâ€™s building modules.

Once we run this command, we will have an outDir folder with two compiled modules inside.
